# MySkincareScheduler: A Skincare Routine Planner

## Description:
### _What will the application do?_
This program schedules the user's skincare routine for a week. The main screen has seven slots, representing the seven days of the week. The user can click on each slot to plan out and view their skincare & haircare regimen for the day. In each day-of-the-week slot, the user can create a "morning" or "night" routine. The user can view and plan out which products they intend to use for the day, when they want to use it (in the night or in the morning), and in what order. The user can also make changes to their routine for any day of the week at any time. Across seven days, this provides a handy beauty routine planner the user can refer to when doing their beauty routine.

### _Who will use it?_
Users interested in skincare, but struggle to keep a consistent routine. These users may often forget the products they are meant to use at various times of day and days of the week.  
 
### _Why is this project of interest to you?_
I like taking care of my skin. It is a therapeutic routine that enriches my life, and I know it does the same for many other people. But with my busy schedule, I sometimes struggle to remember which products I am supposed to use and when. I know many other busy people relate to this struggle, but still want to have a consistent skincare routine so that they can maintain their appearance. So I am making this project to address that need.
